 Overview
 RAG(Retrieval Augmented Generation) is a project that implements a chatting interface
 capable of answering questions based on a restaurant's FAQ PDF. It utilizes LangFlow to
 integrate Azure OpenAI embeddings and handles keys and tokens, while AstraDB is used for
 storing vectorized words and sentences.
 Features
 ● ChatInterface: Interactive chat interface to answer queries based on the FAQ PDF.
 ● Integration with Azure OpenAI: Uses Azure OpenAI embeddings for accurate answer
 retrieval.
 ● Vector Storage: AstraDB is used to store vectorized representations of words and
 sentences.
 ● EnhancedRetrieval: Combines retrieval and generation for accurate and relevant
 answers.
 Installation
 To get started with this project, follow the steps below:
 Prerequisites
 ● Python 3.7+
 ● AzureOpenAI API key
● AstraDB credentials
 ● Necessary Python libraries (listed in requirements.txt)
 Steps
 Clone the Repository
 bash
 Copy code
 git clone https://github.com/taakasj/RAG.git
 cd RAG
 1.
 Install Dependencies
 bash
 Copy code
 pip install-r requirements.txt
 2.
 Set Up Environment Variables Create a .env file in the root directory and add your Azure
 OpenAI API key and AstraDB credentials.
 bash
 Copy code
 AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key
 ASTRA_DB_ID=your_astra_db_id
 ASTRA_DB_REGION=your_astra_db_region
 ASTRA_DB_KEYSPACE=your_astra_db_keyspace
 ASTRA_DB_APPLICATION_TOKEN=your_astra_db_application_token
 3.
 Run the Application
 bash
 Copy code
 python app.py
 4.
 Usage
 After installation, run the application as described above. Open your browser and navigate to
 the specified URL (usually http://localhost:5000). You will be greeted with a chat
 interface where you can start asking questions based on the restaurant's FAQ PDF.
